			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a system engineer and I love learning. As we see a transformation of data center utilization moving to the hybrid cloud I am in a position to work in another challenging fast pace engineering discipline. I have the troubleshooting and critical thinking to learn anything and I am motivated to be a true expert in the next step of my engineering career.</p>
			<p>I have always dreamed of working somewhere with a high energy and a meaningful core motivation. More importantly I have envisioned working with a team of people I can truly learn from and build my skill sets while equally providing valuable output that makes us better as a team.</p>
 			<p>Creating something that can help people, solve needs, and eliminate stress is what I have always aspired to be a part of. Your company's messages and goals align perfectly with what I am looking for in a work environment and I believe I am hungry enough to prove I am can be an asset to your team.</p>
 			<p>While my skill set and experience align with what you are currently looking for I am excited to learn. I am currently building my own battle bot and I love code. I believe to really become a master at anything I need to have real world problems to solve because that is what really inspires me. </p>
